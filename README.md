## Apiflow - Simplifying API Testing with Logical Drag-and-Drop Flows

### 🚀 Problem Statement

API testing can be tedious and complex, often requiring extensive scripting knowledge. This makes it challenging for non-technical users to create and test API workflows efficiently. While tools like Postman Flows offer great features, they are not open-source, limiting customization and community-driven innovation.

### 🎥 Demo

🔗 Live Project: [Apiflow on Vercel](https://api-flow-3ai6.vercel.app/)
🔗 Source Code: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/emee-dev/api-flow)
🔗 Video Walkthrough: [YouTube]() (Coming Soon)

### 💡 Solution

**Apiflow** is an open-source alternative to Postman Flows, designed to revolutionize API testing and automation. With its intuitive **drag-and-drop** interface, Apiflow enables both developers and non-technical users to visually design, execute, and debug complex API workflows effortlessly.

### ✨ Features Implemented

🚀 Due to a late hackathon entry, the current prototype focuses on core functionality with essential node types:

- **Start Node** - Initializes the workflow.
- **HTTP Request Node** - Sends API requests with customizable headers, methods, and URLs.
- **Log Node** - Displays output for debugging and tracking execution.
- **Terminate Node** - Stops workflow execution based on defined conditions.
- **End Node** - Marks the successful completion of a workflow.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js** - Frontend framework for a seamless UI experience.
- **React Flow** - Enables dynamic visualization of nodes and edges.
- **TypeScript** - Ensures type safety and scalability.

### 🚀 Future Enhancements

- 📌 Advanced node types (conditionals, loops, data transformations).
- 💾 Database and state management for persistent workflows.
- 🔄 Export/Import functionality for easy workflow sharing.
- 📖 Integration with API documentation tools for better usability.

### 🌍 Why It Matters

Apiflow democratizes API testing by making it accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise. Unlike proprietary solutions, it fosters transparency, flexibility, and **community-driven development**—empowering users to contribute and enhance the platform.

### 🔥 Conclusion

Despite time constraints, Apiflow demonstrates the **power of open-source innovation** in API testing. This submission lays the groundwork for a robust, user-friendly API workflow automation tool—one that can evolve with the contributions of the developer community. 🚀💡
